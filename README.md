## Project Overview

We plan to create a one dimensional LED dueling game. In this game, players will compete in timing based activities to score points against the opponent by manipulating a line of LEDs via user inputs.

## Educational Value Added

Over the course of this project we hope to develop the following skills.
    -Learning how to address individual devices through minimal input/outputs.
    -Learning about different LEDs and LED arrays and how LED displays in the real world operate.
    -Become familar with arduino IDE and the microcontroller's limitations.
    -Troubleshooting timing delays with user inputs and the game's outputs.
    -Working through a real world design processs by attempting to create a consumer product.

## Tasks

1. Addressing and communicating with each individual LED.
2. Provide proper power to all LEDs and Arduino.
3. Test input devices (i.e. buttons, joysticks) with LEDs using Arduino.
4. Program game and perform test.
5. Enhancing functionality, adding misc. features.
6. Build a case adept to consumer needs.

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

1. Both members will keep and update an engineering notebook on Google Docs.
2. We will provide very short reports after each task.
3. Major milestone videos on YouTube.
4. Final product report and video.

## BOM + Component Cost

TBD

## Timeline

Dates and milestones are TBD.
Goal: Have working game by the end of the semester
